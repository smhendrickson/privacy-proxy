                         Private Access Tokens
                      draft-private-access-tokens

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for issuing and redeeming privacy-
   preserving access tokens.  These tokens can adhere to an issuance
   policy, allowing a service to limit access according to the policy
   without tracking client identity.

1.  Introduction

   In many systems, passive, persistent signals such as IP addresses are
   used for enforcing policies.  Typically, servers use these signals as
   weak client identifiers.  Clients coming from a single IP address may
   be limited in how much content they can access over a given time
   period (often referred to as a "metered paywall"), or access from an
   IP address may be rate-limited to prevent fraud and abuse.  When the
   IP address signal is unavailable, perhaps due to the use of a proxy
   network, servers are left without a suitable functional replacement.

   This document proposes using Private Acess Tokens, using RSA Blind
   Signatures as defined in [PRIVATETOKEN], as a replacement for these
   signals.  These tokens are privately issued to clients and then
   redeemed by servers in such a way that the issuance and redemption
   events for a given token are unlinkable.  Fundamentally, using tokens
   in lieu of per-client signals for policy enforcement seemingly
   requires some entity to know both the client and policy.  However,
   with appropriate mediation and sesparation between parties involved
   in the issuance and redemption protocols, it is possible to limit
   this information leakage without functional regressions.

   This document describes a protocol for mediating the issuance and
   redemption of Private Access Tokens with the following properties:

   1.  The Mediator enforces and maintains a mapping between client
       identifiers and anonymous redeemer identifiers;

   2.  The Issuer enforces policies keyed by anonymous client identifier
       and redeemer identifier, without learning the real client
       identity; and

   3.  The Redeemer learns whether a given client has a valid Private
       Access Token for its policy.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

   The protocol involves four entites:

   1.  Client: the entity responsible for requesting Private Access
       Tokens and redeeming them.

   2.  Mediator: the entity responsible for authenticating Clients,
       using information such as account names or device identities.

   3.  Issuer: the entity responsible for issuing Private Access Tokens
       on behalf of a given Redeemer, according to the Redeemer's
       policy.

   4.  Redeemer: the entity responsible for verifying Private Access
       Tokens and providing a service to the Client.

   In this architecture, the Mediator, Issuer, and Redeemer each have
   limited knowledge regarding the Client's actions, and only know
   enough to provide their necessary functionality.  The pieces of
   information are identified in Section 2.1.

   The Mediator is able to see the Client's actual identity information
   (CLIENT_ID), the Issuer being targeted (ISSUER_NAME), and the period
   of time for which the Issuer's policy is valid
   (ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW).  The Mediator does not know the identity of
   the Redeemer the Client is trying to access (ORIGIN_ID), but instead
   sees an anonymous version (ANON_ORIGIN_ID).

   The Issuer is able to see the identity of the Redeemer (ORIGIN_ID),
   but only sees an anonymous identifier for a client (ANON_CLIENT_ID).
   Issuers maintain the details of policy enforcement on behalf of the
   Redeemer.  For example, a given policy might be, "issue at most N
   tokens to each client."  Example policies and their use cases are
   discussed in Section 6.

   The Redeemer, which represents the service being accessed by the
   client, only receives a Private Access Token from the client.

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined to refer to the different pieces of
   information passed through the system:

   ISSUER_NAME:  The Issuer Name identifies which Issuer is able to
      provide tokens for a Client.  The Client sends the Issuer Name to
      the Mediator so the Mediator know where to forward requests.  Each
      Issuer is associated with a specific ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW.

   ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW:  The Issuer Policy Window defines the period
      over which an Issuer will track access policy.  The ANON_CLIENT_ID
      that the Mediator derives is specific to a Policy Window, meaning
      that a CLIENT_ID will not map to the same ANON_CLIENT_ID after the
      Policy Window has elapsed.

   ORIGIN_ID:  The Origin Identifier represents the service for which
      the Client is requesting a Private Access Token.  Conceptually,
      this can map to a website.  The Origin Identifier corresponds to a
      single public key that can be used to sign tokens.

   ANON_ORIGIN_ID:  The Anonymous Origin Identifier is generated by the
      Client and marked on requests to the Mediator and through to the
      Issuer.

   CLIENT_ID:  The Client Identifier represents a single client that has
      authenticated to the Mediator.  The specifics of this identity are
      up to the Mediator, but it may be based on an attested device
      identifier or an account login that the Mediator can verify.

   ANON_CLIENT_ID:  The Anonymous Client Identifier is generated by the
      Mediator and used when forwarding requests to the Issuer.  The
      Mediator maintains a mapping such that there is exactly one
      ANON_CLIENT_ID for each CLIENT_ID + ANON_ORIGIN_ID pair during a
      specific ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW.

3.  API Endpoints

   It is assumed that Issuers make Oblivious HTTP configurations and
   policy verification keys available via the following API endpoints:

   *  OHTTP configuration: /.well-known/ohttp-config

   *  Policy verification key: /.well-known/verification-key/policy=?

   [OPEN ISSUE: Provide an API to let the Mediator learn the
   ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW]

   The OHTTP configuration is defined in [OHTTP].  The public
   verification key is a struct of the following format:

   struct {
     opaque public_key[Nk]; // Defined in [BLINDSIG]
   } VerificationKey;

   The contents of VerificationKey are an RSA public key for use with
   the RSA Blind Signature protocol [BLINDSIG].

   Issuers also advertise a Private Access Token request URI template
   [RFC6570] for generating access tokens.  For example, one template
   for the Issuer might be https://issuer.net/access-token-request.

   Mediators advertise an Oblivious HTTP URI template [RFC6570] for
   proxying protocol messages to Issuers.  For example, one template for
   the Mediator might be https://mediator.net/relay-access-token-
   request.

4.  Issuance

   Issuance assumes the Client has the following information:

   *  Origin name (ORIGIN_NAME), a URI referring to the Redeemer
      (origin) [RFC6454];

   *  Origin token public key (ORIGIN_KEY), a blind signature public
      key; and

   *  Origin identifier (ORIGIN_ID), a 32-byte collision-resistant hash
      that identifies the origin token public key.  See Section 4.2 for
      details about its construction.

   Moreover, it assumes that the Client and Mediator have a secure and
   Mediator-authenticated HTTPS connection.  See Section 7 for
   additional about this channel.

   Issuance begins by Clients generating a Private Access Token request,
   starting as follows:

   nonce = random(32)
   blinded_req, blind_inv = rsabssa_blind(ORIGIN_KEY, nonce)

   [OPEN ISSUE: rewrite this in terms of a generic blind signature
   scheme (not RSA specific)]

   The Client then constructs a Private Access Token request using
   ORIGIN_ID and blinded_req, encoded using TLS notation from [TLS13],
   Section 3:

   struct {
     opaque anon_origin_id[32];
     opaque blinded_req[Nk];
   } AccessTokenRequest;

   The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to the Issuer with
   this request as the body.  The media type for this request is
   "message/access-token-request".  The Client includes the "Sec-CH-
   TokenOrigin" header in this request, whose value is ORIGIN_NAME.  An
   example request is shown below.

   :method = POST
   :scheme = https
   :authority = issuer.net
   :path = /access-token-request
   accept = message/access-token-request
   cache-control = no-cache, no-store
   content-type = message/access-token-request
   content-length = Nk
   Sec-CH-TokenOrigin = https://example.com

   <Bytes containing the AccessTokenRequest>

   Then the Client encapsulates this request using Oblivious HTTP,
   yielding an encapsulated HTTP message.  The Client includes the "Sec-
   CH-AnonymousOriginID" header in this request, whose value is
   ORIGIN_ID.  Finally, the Client sends this encapsulated request to
   the Mediator's proxy URI.  An example request is shown below.

   :method = POST
   :scheme = https
   :authority = mediator.net
   :path = /relay-access-token-request
   accept = message/ohttp-req
   cache-control = no-cache, no-store
   content-type = message/ohttp-req
   content-length = ...
   Sec-CH-AnonymousOriginID = ORIGIN_ID

   <Bytes containing the encapsulated HTTP message for the Issuer>

   Upon receipt, the Mediator computes ANON_CLIENT_ID, which is a fixed-
   length byte string for the given Client.  See Section 4.1 for details
   of its computation.

   Before forwarding the Client's encapsulated request to the Issuer,
   the Mediator includes a header listing the ANON_CLIENT_ID, "Sec-CH-
   AnonymousClientID".  An example request is shown below.

   :method = POST
   :scheme = https
   :authority = issuer.net
   :path = /access-token-request
   accept = message/ohttp-req
   cache-control = no-cache, no-store
   content-type = message/ohttp-req
   content-length = ...
   Sec-CH-AnonymousOriginID = ORIGIN_ID
   Sec-CH-AnonymousClientID =

   <Bytes containing the encapsulated HTTP message for the Issuer>

   [OPEN ISSUE: Square this with OHTTP, which requires that proxies MUST
   NOT add information about the client to the forwarded request]

   Upon receipt of the Client's encapsulated request, the Issuer checks
   for the "Sec-CH-AnonymousClientID" header.  If absent, the Issuer
   aborts and returns a 400 error to the Mediator.  If present, the
   Issuer decapsulates the request.  If this fails, the Issuer aborts
   and returns a 400 error to the Mediator.  If decapsulation succeeds,
   the Issuer checks for the "Sec-CH-TargetOrigin" header.  If absent,
   the Issuer aborts and returns a 400 error to the Mediator.  If
   present, the Issuer proceeds extracts ANON_CLIENT_ID from the "Sec-
   CH-AnonymousClientID" header, ORIGIN_NAME from the "Sec-CH-
   TargetOrigin" header, and ANON_ORIGIN_ID from
   AccessTokenRequest.anon_origin_id, and proceeds as follows.

   First, check to see if there are any prior token requests for the
   given (ANON_CLIENT_ID, ORIGIN_NAME) pair.  If so, and if the
   corresponding ANON_ORIGIN_ID does not match that of the current
   request, the Issuer aborts and returns a 400 error to the Mediator.

   If this is not the case, determine if the token request can be
   satisfied for the given (ANON_CLIENT_ID, ORIGIN_NAME) pair, according
   to the access token policy.  If the policy does not admit issuance,
   the Issuer aborts and returns a 400 error to the Mediator.

   If the Issuer local state and policy admit a token, the Issuer
   completes the issuance flow by computing a blinded response as
   follows:

   blind_sig = rsabssa_blind_sign(skP, AccessTokenRequest.blinded_req)

   "skP" is the private key corresponding to ORIGIN_KEY, known only to
   the Issuer.

   The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose body
   consists of blind_sig.  The Issuer encapsulates this as the response
   to the Client's request, sets the media type to "message/access-
   token-response", and sends the result to the Mediator.

   The Issuer then updates any local state for the (ANON_CLIENT_ID,
   ORIGIN_KEY) tuple as needed.  For example, if the policy is meant to
   bound the number of tokens given to a given ANON_CLIENT_ID, then the
   Issuer should increment the number of tokens issued for the given
   ANON_CLIENT_ID.

   [OPEN ISSUE: describe Issuer state requirements somewhere up top,
   including (1) the client<>origin stable mapping and (2)
   client<>policy token mapping]

   The Mediator forwards the encapsulated response to the Client without
   modification.

   Upon receipt, the Client decapsulates the response and, if
   successful, processes the body as follows:

   sig = rsabssa_finalize(ORIGIN_KEY, nonce, blind_sig, blind_inv)

   If this succeeds, the Client then constructs a Private Access Token
   as described in [PRIVATETOKEN] using the token nonce and output sig.

4.1.  Anonymous Client ID

   ANON_CLIENT_ID MUST be generated in such a way that any Client
   identifying information cannot be recovered.  It also MUST be unique
   for each ANON_ORIGIN_ID during a given ISSUER_POLICY_WINDOW.

   [OPEN ISSUE: Does the mediator modify ANON_ORIGIN_ID into
   ANON_ORIGIN_ID_PRIME before passing to the issuer?  Or does the
   client learn about the window changes and switch the ANON_ORIGIN_ID
   accordingly?]

4.2.  Anonymous Origin ID

   ANON_ORIGIN_ID MUST be a stable and unpredictable 32-byte value
   computed by the Client.  Clients MUST NOT change this value across
   origins.  Doing so will result in token issuance failuer by the
   mediator.

   One possible mechanism for implementing this identifier is for the
   Client to store a mapping between the ORIGIN_NAME and a randomly
   generated ANON_ORIGIN_ID for future requests.  Alternatively, the
   Client can compute a pseudorandom function (PRF) keyed by a per-
   client secret (CLIENT_SECRET) over the ORIGIN_NAME, e.g.,
   ANON_ORIGIN_ID = HKDF(secret=CLIENT_SECRET, salt="",
   info=ORIGIN_NAME).

5.  Redemption

   The Client is assumed to have the policy verification key before
   redeeming a Private Access Token.

   [OPEN ISSUE: describe how Clients can use OHTTP to fetch the policy
   key from Issuers]

   Redeemers can request that tokens be spent by Clients for given
   resources using the WWW-Authenticate header, as follows:

   WWW-Authenticate: PrivacyToken realm="<policy>"

   Upon receipt, Clients can spend a Private Access Token with the
   Authorize header, as follows:

   Authorization: PrivacyToken t=abc

   Where the token is a serialized Private Access Token corresponding to
   the given Redeemer policy.

6.  Policies and Uses Cases

   TODO: example policies and deployments of this (diagram) -- include:
   - single origin, single policy - single origin, multiple policies -
   issuer and redeemer as same entity

7.  Security Considerations

   The HTTPS connection between Client and Mediator is minimally
   Mediator-authenticated.  Mediators can also require Client
   authentication if they wish to restrict Private Access Token proxying
   to trusted or otherwise authenticated Clients.  Absent some form of
   Client authentication, Mediators can use other per-Client information
   for the client identifier mapping, such as IP addressess.

   token-response" MIME type
